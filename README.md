# rust_library
Creating rust libraries to augment my learnings in my journey to learn rust. 

This repository will store all of the libraries, codes, boiler plates that I have created while I am in my journey to learning rust.
I find it a lot faster to learn when I try to implement the theories that I learn. This will also allow me to document and show my
learnings to others and the future me, so that I may have a reference in the future that I believe could use the ideas I have 
previously learned.

Commit 1.0 - 2/14/2025:

This is the initial revision, the library flexdsa is uploaded. It is the first library I have created while learning rust.
The goal of this library is to help me learn the basics such as variables, functions, data structures, implementations, traits,
ownership as well as a intermediate learnings suchs as generics and library creation.

flexdsa is a flexible data sturcture and algorithm library that will allow the users to use algorithms such as binary search,
merge sort, quick sort and the data sructure of graph with its corresponding Depth first search and Breadth First search.

testflexdsa is a boiler plate to test the library and will also serve as an example on how to use the library for the future user.
